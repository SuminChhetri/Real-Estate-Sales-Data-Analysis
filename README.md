# Real Estate Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of real estate sales data from four provinces in Canada: Ontario, Nova Scotia (NS), British Columbia (BC), and Quebec. Utilizing analytical tools and techniques, I generated a detailed report to visualize sales performance, profit margins, and agent effectiveness, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

## Situation

In a highly competitive real estate market, understanding sales dynamics is essential for optimizing operations and improving profitability. The objective of this analysis was to compile and evaluate sales data to derive insights that can enhance strategic planning and execution for real estate firms.

## Task

The main tasks involved in this project included:

- Generating realistic sales data using ChatGPT.
- Merging and cleaning data from four different provinces.
- Analyzing sales performance and profit margins.
- Developing a detailed report outlining key findings and insights.

## Action

### Data Generation and Preparation

- **Data Generation**: Employed ChatGPT to generate realistic sales data representing various real estate transactions across the four provinces. This included:
  - Sales amounts
  - Property types
  - Sales agents
  - Dates of sales

- **Data Merging and Cleaning**:
  - Merged datasets from Ontario, NS, BC, and Quebec to form a comprehensive sales dataset.
  - Corrected duplicates and null values to ensure data integrity.
  - Maintained a consistent format across all data entries.

### Data Analysis

- Conducted a thorough analysis of the merged dataset, focusing on the following metrics:
  - **Sales by Location**: Analyzed total sales and profits by region, represented in a tree map.
  - **Profit by Location**: Visualized profits across different provinces using a bar graph.
  - **Total Profit by Property Type**: Summarized profit distribution with a pie chart.
  - **Sales Performance by Sales Person**: Evaluated the effectiveness of agents through a heat map.
  - **Sales and Profit Trends**: Illustrated trends over time with line graphs.
  - **Summary Table**: Created a comprehensive table summarizing all key metrics.

### Data Management

- Managed the visibility of data tables effectively to enhance clarity in the report. Ensured only relevant metrics were included in the final analysis.

## Result

The completed report provided valuable insights into:

- Sales trends by month and location.
- Top agents and their sales performance.
- Sales target and the total sales
- Sales Quantity VS Target Quantity
- Profit margins by property type and location.

This analysis equips stakeholders with actionable data, helping them refine strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Reflection

This project significantly improved my skills in data preparation, merging, and analysis. Key learnings included the importance of data integrity and clarity in presenting insights. Future enhancements could involve integrating automated data updates and exploring advanced analytics techniques for deeper insights. I recommend others leverage AI tools like ChatGPT for data generation to expedite the initial stages of data preparation.
